## Style Guidelines:

- Dominant Background: Use light colors (white, light gray, pale beige) to create a clean, modern, and welcoming feel. This provides ample "white space" (negative space) which helps content stand out and prevents the design from feeling cluttered.
- Secondary color: Light blue, mint, or soft pastel for sections and text (30%).
- Accent color: Vibrant color for focal points like call-to-action buttons (10%).
- Body font: Choose a clean and readable font like 'Open Sans' or 'Lato'.
- Headline font: Use a slightly more decorative font like 'Raleway' or 'Poppins' for headings.
- Use simple, elegant icons related to singing and music.
- Implement a clean and spacious layout with plenty of white space.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to add visual interest without being distracting.
